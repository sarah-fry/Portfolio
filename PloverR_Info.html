                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p class="lead">
                    This project involved a statistical evaluation of <strong>Piping Plover chick survival</strong> comparing <strong>treatment nests</strong> (nests protected by cages) versus <strong>control nests</strong> (unprotected nests).
                    The analysis was conducted using the R programming language to assess the effectiveness of caging as a conservation strategy.
                </p>

                <h2>Objective</h2>
                <p>
                    To determine whether caging Piping Plover nests significantly improves chick survival rates compared to non-caged (control) nests, while also assessing potential regional differences in survival.
                </p>

                <h2>Methods</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Data Collection: Chick survival outcomes were recorded for both treatment and control nests across multiple regions.</li>
                    <li>Statistical Software: Analysis conducted using <strong>R</strong>.</li>
                    <li>Statistical Tests:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Chi-squared tests to compare survival proportions.</li>
                            <li>Logistic regression models to assess survival based on treatment and region.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Visualization: Survival outcomes were plotted using bar graphs and survival curves.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Results</h2>
                <p>
                    Due to the poor goodness of fit, caution should be taken when interpreting these results.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>There is a potential <strong>region effect</strong> on chick survival. Region 5 had five significant comparisons:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Four comparisons were positive, meaning that regions 1–4 had higher apparent survival than region 5.</li>
                            <li>One comparison (Region 6 vs. 5) was negative, meaning that region 6 had higher apparent survival than region 5.</li>
                            <li>Overall, region 5 appears to have lower apparent survival than other regions.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Treatment effect:</strong> There were no statistically significant results suggesting that caged nests had higher post-fledge chick survival compared to non-caged nests.</li>
                    <li>While caging may benefit nest success, it does not appear to confer a long-term survival advantage for chicks after fledging.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Limitations</h2>
                <p>
                    The models and inferences are based on apparent survival, which accounts for individuals lost through death or emigration from the study area. 
                    Recapture probability was not directly assessed; only apparent survival was analyzed.
                </p>

                <h2>Assumption Violations</h2>
                <p>
                    One important assumption that may have been violated is that <strong>individual survival fates are independent</strong>. 
                    Groups of nestmates tend to stay together under parental care, meaning that one chick’s survival outcome could influence others (e.g., increased predator attention or disease transmission within a brood).
                    This potential dependence could affect the validity of the statistical inferences.
                </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>R Programming Language and R Studio</li>

                    </ul>
                    <h2>Reflections</h2>
                    <p>
                        This project marked a turning point in my life. While diving deep into the R programming language to uncover patterns in plover chick survival, I realized how much I enjoyed the process of writing code and using data to tell/show stories about the natural world. 
                        It helped me recognize the powerful connections between ecology and computer science; How technical tools can be used for real-world conservation decisions. 
                        This experience ultimately inspired me to return to school to pursue a degree in computer science, with the goal of combining both fields to create impactful, data-driven solutions for wildlife research and beyond!
