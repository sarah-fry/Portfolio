# ðŸŒ¿ Sarah Fry's Portfolio â€“ Ecology & Code

Welcome to my portfolio! I'm passionate about bridging the gap between **ecology** and **technology**. My work showcases projects that use **data analysis**, **visualization**, and **software tools** to explore and support ecological research and environmental understanding.

Whether it's building tools for fieldwork, visualizing ecological networks, or automating data workflows, I aim to make scientific insight more accessible and impactful through thoughtful code.
